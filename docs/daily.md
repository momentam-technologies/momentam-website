# 📘 Daily Log – Momentam Website

## Day 1 – Project Foundation (2025-10-03)

### Objectives

- [ ] Initialize Next.js website scaffold
- [ ] Configure dependencies (TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, lucide-react)
- [ ] Setup folder structure for content and components
- [ ] Push code to GitHub organization repo
- [ ] Prepare documentation (Daily Log + Handover)

### Progress

- ✅ Initialized Next.js website project (`momentam-website`)
- ✅ Installed and configured core dependencies:
  - TailwindCSS (v4) with `@tailwindcss/postcss`
  - shadcn/ui components
  - `lucide-react` for icons
- ✅ Verified `app/` router-based structure working
- ✅ GitHub repo created and initial commit pushed (`momentam-technologies/momentam-website`)
- ⏳ Modular folder structure for components and content – to finalize in next iteration
- ✅ CI/CD handled automatically via Vercel – pending actual deployment

### Notes / Decisions

- Website is **informational only**, no user auth
- Folder structure will include:
  - `app/` for pages
  - `components/` for reusable UI elements
  - `styles/` for global Tailwind styles
- Using **Tailwind + shadcn/ui** for consistency with web app
- Deployment planned via **Vercel**

### Blockers

- None for Day 1
